# inclusion-impact-project

## Goals:
1. Analyse the differences between businesses that openly claim inclusion features (e.g., Yelps "Open to All" feature).

  
## Scope
* This project will focus on businesses in Montreal, and focusing on analysis between businesses with the "Open to All feature" versus businesses that do not have the "Open to All" (OTA) feature.

### Ideas
*running list of ideas I have to explore during the course of this project*
* Include other diversity/inclusion features: wheelchair accessibility, food allergies in analysis
* Can we predict how much a businesses rating will change if they add the Open to All feature?
* Busineses that have OTA do they charge higher prices? Are they focused on a specific cuisine? Do they have more engaged users?
* Do businesses who identify as "Open to All" reveive higher ratings, better engagement?
* Is there a competitive advantage to identifying Open to All?
* Can we predict the increase in customer ratings, revenue when a business becomes OTA? (depends on data available)

### Out of Scope:
* Cities outside of Montreal
